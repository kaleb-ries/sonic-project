# sonic-project
A prototype for audio navigation and games

# NOTE
In order to start the interface when the html file is running in the browser, the user MUST click enter, there is no visual, audio, or any other sort of signal in  the program that shows this

# Features & Main Menu Commands
* A main menu with audio announcements for settings and help
* The settings menu contains speech volume, music volume and a toggle for music, and speaking rate
* There is currently one game option which contains a 10 by 10 grid; there is no functionality beyond using the arrow keys to move around the grid
* Up and down arrow moves through menus
* Left and right arrows change the value of a setting
* Enter opens a menu or selects a setting so that it can be modified
* Escape goes to the previous menu
* Backspace goes to the main menu
* Space bar says the current item
* Home goes to the top of a menu
* End goes to the bottom of the menu
* Page up goes up in a menu by 5 items
* Page down goes down in a menu by 5 items
NOTE: These commands are specifically for the main menu; when you are in a game, the commands will be customized. The backspace command is the only current command that has the same function in the main menu and every game

# Issues
* Visual elements have not been added, and there is no guide to navigating the audio interface
* The help option doesn't currently do anything
