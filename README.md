# sonic-project
A prototype for audio navigation and games

# Features
* A main menu with audio announcements for settings and help
* A submenu for settings with volume and rate, with functionality to change the volume and rate
* Up and down arrow moves through menus
* Left and right arrows change the value of a setting
* Enter opens a menu or selects a setting so that it can be modified

# Issues
* Since this project is client-side HTML only, sounds cannot immediately be played upon opening the HTML file, so the currently selected item will not be announced when the HTML loads
* Visual elements have not been added, and there is no guide to navigating the audio interface
